Resolving the merge conflict in `README.md`. Reviewing the conflict section:

Resolving the conflict by keeping the newer runtime input approach, consistent with the rest of the README.

Checking for linting errors, then staging the resolved file:


[2 tools called]


Resolved the merge conflict in `README.md`. Kept the newer approach (runtime API key input) to match the rest of the documentation. Removed the old environment variable setup step.

**What I did:**
- Removed the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
- Kept step 3 as "运行程序（程序会提示您输入 API Key）" (run the program, which will prompt for API Key)
- Removed the old step 3 and 4 that required setting the environment variable
- Staged the resolved file

The conflict is resolved. Continue the rebase with:
```bash
git rebase --continue
```
```

## Me:

```
git rebase --continue
```
